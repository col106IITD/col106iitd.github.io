**Evaluation:** The tentative course evaluation policy is:

Lab Quizzes (best 3 out of 4):  30%
Minor:  15%
Major:  20%
Quizzes (best 3 out of 4) :  30%
Passing criteria: % in course total

Audit-pass criteria: 30% in course total

Acadmic Honesty: Cheating or allowing anyone to copy in exams/lab-assignments would lead to strict disciplinary action. Typical penalty would include Fail grade in the course.
