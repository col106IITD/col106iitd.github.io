**Evaluation:** The tentative course evaluation policy is:

- Lab Quizzes (best 3 out of 4):  30%
- Minor:  20%
- Major:  20%
- Quizzes (best 3 out of 4) :  30%
- Passing criteria: % in course total

Audit-pass criteria: 50% in course total

Acadmic Honesty: Cheating or allowing anyone to copy in exams/lab-assignments would lead to strict disciplinary action. Typical penalty would include Fail grade in the course.
