**Evaluation:** The tentative course evaluation policy is:

- Lab Quizzes (best 3 out of 4):  30%
- Minor:  15%
- Major:  20%
- Quizzes (best 3 out of 4) :  30%
- Attendance (lectures + labs linearly scaled) : 5%
- Passing criteria: % in course total
- Audit-pass criteria: B- and above are eligible for a NP grade. You should also score at least 50% in both the written and lab quizzes.
  
    
**Academic Honesty:** Cheating or allowing anyone to copy in exams/lab-assignments would lead to strict disciplinary action. Typical penalty would include Fail grade in the course.

**Attendance Record:**
